#### Background
The Diffusion Model is used to transform noisy multidimensional data into an interpretable, low-dimensional representation. An example of this is in vision models that are used to classify images (ex: ResNet, DALL-E).
<br/>
An "EZ" Diffusion Model is a simplified version of this that can compute estimated parameters from summary statistics.
